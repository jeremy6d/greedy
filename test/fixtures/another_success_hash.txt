Basically Shirley Sherrod at the USDA allegedly claimed to refuse help to white farmers.  The video of the talk where she mentioned this was posted on some conservative blogs and Fox News (Specifically Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity) grabbed the story up.  Sherrod was forced to resign from her position on the grounds that her actions were racist.  Then the full, unedited video was posted, and it turned out that she was just providing an example of learning from past mistakes.  The Obama administration apologized and offered her another job. <br><br>Here's the problem...<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22sherrod.html?_r=1&amp;hp\"> the media has made this into another criticism of the Obama administration</a>.  I agree, they should not have trusted these blogs and should have looked into it further before taking such harsh action.  But the Obama administration is not to blame here!  It's the conservative bloggers who are to blame!  More and more, they're making shit up just to get people upset - this is just one case out of many - and in this case, they've won despite being exposed.  Conservative bloggers and talking heads need to be called out for spreading this kind of misinformation, and not allowed to scurry away under the criticism of Obama.  Why are we not hearing profuse apologies coming from O'Reilly and Hannity?<div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2029194950153680522-3199030301217780994?l=jmtrom.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EideticIlluminations?a=WcA87ld-1nc:SiNRSQT2kSY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EideticIlluminations?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EideticIlluminations?a=WcA87ld-1nc:SiNRSQT2kSY:63t7Ie-LG7Y\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EideticIlluminations?d=63t7Ie-LG7Y\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EideticIlluminations?a=WcA87ld-1nc:SiNRSQT2kSY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EideticIlluminations?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EideticIlluminations/~4/WcA87ld-1nc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction"=>"ltr"}, "categories"=>["user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/reading-list", "user/17398194162169227368/label/libertarian", "user/17398194162169227368/label/left", "user/17398194162169227368/label/blog", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/fresh"], "updated"=>1279761780}, {"likingUsers"=>[], "comments"=>[], "author"=>"Jesse Walker", "title"=>"Economics Am One Lesson", "crawlTimeMsec"=>"1279761562221", "published"=>1279754100, "annotations"=>[], "alternate"=>[{"href"=>"http://reason.com/blog/2010/07/21/economics-am-one-lesson", "type"=>"text/html"}], "id"=>"tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc4fee3fe7026dbc", "origin"=>{"title"=>"Reason Magazine Full Feed", "htmlUrl"=>"http://reason.com/", "streamId"=>"feed/http://reason.com/allarticles/index.xml"}, "content"=>{"content"=>"<div>\n<p>Art Caden presents <a href=\"http://blog.mises.org/13312/principles-of-bizarro-economics/\">nine\nprinciples of bizarro economics</a>.</p>\t\t</div>", "direction"=>"ltr"}, "categories"=>["user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/reading-list", "user/17398194162169227368/label/libertarian", "user/17398194162169227368/label/politics", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/fresh"], "updated"=>1279754100}, {"likingUsers"=>[], "comments"=>[], "title"=>"I Once Wrote . . .", "crawlTimeMsec"=>"1279761209235", "published"=>1279759386, "annotations"=>[], "alternate"=>[{"href"=>"http://agonist.org/sean_paul_kelley/20100721/i_once_wrote", "type"=>"text/html"}], "id"=>"tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7a276f46f7333619", "origin"=>{"title"=>"The Agonist - thoughtful, global, timely", "htmlUrl"=>"http://agonist.org", "streamId"=>"feed/http://agonist.org/xml"}, "summary"=>{"content"=>"<p> . . . an essay on Orwell that went down the memory hole.</p>", "direction"=>"ltr"}, "categories"=>["user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/reading-list", "user/17398194162169227368/label/economics", "user/17398194162169227368/label/blog", "user/17398194162169227368/label/liberal", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/fresh", "Ruminations"], "updated"=>1279759386}, {"likingUsers"=>[], "comments"=>[], "author"=>"The Cornucopia Institute", "title"=>"Farming the Future", "crawlTimeMsec"=>"1279760824216", "published"=>1279760207, "annotations"=>[], "alternate"=>[{"href"=>"http://www.cornucopia.org/2010/07/farming-the-future/", "type"=>"text/html"}], "id"=>"tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d889579195701d19", "origin"=>{"title"=>"Cornucopia Institute", "htmlUrl"=>"http://www.cornucopia.org", "streamId"=>"feed/http://cornucopia.org/index.php/feed/"}, "content"=>{"content"=>"<p><strong>We’ve been waiting 32 years for the state to map and protect Hawai‘i’s Important Agricultural Lands. The moment may be at hand.</strong></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://honoluluweekly.com/cover/2010/07/farming-the-future/\">Honolulu Weekly</a><br>\nBy Ragnar Carlson</em></p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii ‘78</strong></p>\n<p>The 1978 Constitutional Convention was the most significant moment in Hawaii politics since statehood. Among other sweeping reforms–the creation of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the balanced-budget requirement, the establishment of term limits and the adoption of ‘Olelo Hawaii as one of two official state languages–delegates proposed an amendment designed to protect agriculture in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>A generation ago, sugar was everywhere in the Islands, but the industry was well into its decline. Con-Con delegates, led by young Kauai biology professor–and future Honolulu mayor–Jeremy Harris, worried along with the rest of the Islands that out-of-control housing development would overwhelm Hawaii agriculture.<span></span></p>\n<p>The result of the convention’s discussions was this passage:</p>\n<p>“The State shall conserve and protect agricultural lands, promote diversified agriculture, increase agricultural self-sufficiency and assure the availability of agriculturally suitable lands…Lands identified by the State as important agricultural lands needed to fulfill the purposes above shall not be reclassified by the State or rezoned by its political subdivisions without meeting the standards and criteria established by the legislature and approved by a two-thirds vote of the body responsible for the reclassification or rezoning action.”</p>\n<p>Sustainability, it turns out, was on the agenda in 1978–and not only on the minds of idealistic young convention delegates. The Important Agricultural Lands amendment went onto the ballot that fall, where it was approved by voters as Article XI ,Section 3.</p>\n<p>Had the state government acted then–that is, had it fulfilled a constitutionally mandated duty to keep agricultural land in the hands of farmers–Hawaii would almost certainly be a very different place in 2010. In the years following the Con-Con, the collapse of Hawaii’s sugar and pineapple industries left thousands of acres of prime farmland open to new uses, and developers were ready to satisfy skyrocketing demand for housing. The housing industry thrived, the farming industry–from monoculture to family farms–nose-dived, and Hawaii woke from three decades of breathless growth–dreamy or nightmarish, depending on where you stand–into a strange new century of tourism and, well, nothing else. In the face of these forces, the state did nothing on Important Agricultural Lands for almost 30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Planting the seed</strong></p>\n<p>Clift Tsuji was elected to the State House of Representatives from the Hilo area in 2004. He now chairs the Agriculture Committee. “Immediately,” he said last week, “I was given the historic background of all of this, and a number of lawmakers said, ‘We’ve been trying to do this for 30 years, and nothing has happened and it just goes on and on.’” Tsuji said the issue immediately became a priority. “Hawaii was built on ag. The economic demise of agriculture is well known. If we have any thoughts of trying to put ag in the forefront, we better get off our bottoms and start doing something.”</p>\n<p>But do what? Voters had approved the constitutional amendment in broad form, but over the decades of inaction, no one had been able to agree on what constituted important ag land, how it would be mapped and inventoried, or what kinds of incentives and compensation would be offered to landowners whose property was deemed too agriculturally important to ever be rezoned.</p>\n<p>In 2005, the Legislature passed Act 183, which established–finally–the standards and criteria for the determination of what farmlands should be protected in perpetuity. Among the most important criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n• Capable of producing sustained high agricultural yields when treated and managed according to accepted farming methods and technology\n<p>• Economic value, whether for export or consumption</p>\n<p>• Viability for future use, even among lands not currently in production</p>\n<p>• High soil quality.</p>\n<p>• Value for traditional Hawaiian agricultural uses, such as taro cultivation</p>\n<p>• Viability for coffee, vineyards, aquaculture</p>\n<p>• Potential for biofuels</p>\n<p>• Access to water</p>\n<p>• Access to infrastructure needed to make agriculture viable, particularly roads</p></ol>\n<p>Left unanswered in 2005, however, were the twin questions of how to compensate landowners for taking their lands out of possible rezoning and redevelopment essentially forever, and how to ensure that the state actually accomplished the purpose of the IAL amendment, which was not about zoning, after all, but about ensuring a viable agricultural future for Hawaii.</p>\n<p><strong>Full bloom?</strong></p>\n<p>Three years later, in 2008, Act 233 finally brought IAL into a kind of reality by responding to these questions. The law set up a detailed process of compensation for landowners and established a timeline for landowners to voluntarily designate 85 percent of their holdings as IAL, in exchange for what amounts to a fast-tracked development process on the remaining 15 percent. In short, this means that a landholder could agree to set aside 8,500 acres from residential development permanently, with the assurance that the remaining 1,500 would receive an expedited–though not guaranteed–permitting and rezoning process.</p>\n<p>For farmers themselves, Act 233 promised substantial tax credits and other subsidies designed to make farming more viable in the Islands. These include loan guarantees, lending at below-market rates and a range of tax-credits for investment in agricultural infrastructure.</p>\n<p>That was critical, says David Arakawa, director of the Land Use Research Foundation of Hawaii, because it clarified that Important Agricultural Lands law is in fact not primarily about land, but about farming.</p>\n<p>“The IAL process has taken a long time, but more important than a sense of urgency is the understanding, which is emerging, that this is a new paradigm for Hawaii. IAL is first and foremost about supporting farmers. It’s not about how much land you take. You can have all the land in the world. If you don’t have water, and you don’t have labor, and you don’t have incentives, you can designate all the land you want, and you’re only going to have soil and stone.”</p>\n<p>The law also established a window–set to close on July 1, 2011–for landowners to voluntarily designate land as IAL. After that point, it will be left to the counties to prepare their own IAL maps, and for the state Land Use Commission to unilaterally designate lands. All of the incentives–including the 85/15 rule–will still apply.</p>\n<p>Alexander &amp; Baldwin has been the first major landowner to step into the IAL process, having designated more than 27,000 acres on Maui and 3,700 on Kauai since 2009. According to a Honolulu city official who asked not to be identified, both Kamehameha Schools and Castle &amp; Cooke are in the process of preparing designations.</p>\n<p>With the voluntary deadline just a year away, only Kauai County has so far begun the process of preparing its IAL maps–because only Kauai had state funding with which to do it.</p>\n<p>On Oahu, City Councilman Donovan Dela Cruz put money into the budget for the project this summer. “The state didn’t give the counties the funding. Most time there’s an unfunded mandate, the countries won’t do it, and that’s what happened with IAL. I put half a million into the budget this year so we can do this.”</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Arakawa, who is part of the city’s Agricultural Development Task Force, called for the city to begin work on mapping the IAL in anticipation of next summer’s deadline on voluntary designation.</p>\n<p>Bill Brennan, spokesman for Mayor Mufi Hannemann, could not immediately say where the city was on the release of the funding, but one official, who asked not to be named, said the city’s planning department was simply waiting for the funds to become available.</p>\n<p><strong>The proof’s in the planting</strong></p>\n<p>Going forward, Arakawa and Nalo Farms owner Dean Okimoto both say that IAL is long overdue, but caution that the designation of land will not in itself revitalize farming in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Arakawa actually points to Okimoto, who is on leave as head of the Hawaii Farm Bureau, as an example of how strapped farmers truly are. “Who’s the most famous farmer in Hawaii? Maybe Richard Ha on the Big Island, maybe the folks at MAO Organic Farm, but probably Dean Okimoto. Guess how many acres this guy, this giant of farming has in production? Five. Five acres. If that doesn’t tell you what’s going on, nothing will.”</p>\n<p>“There are some good incentives in place but if we could get everything that was necessary, it would make more of a difference,” says Okimoto. He says red-tape at the county level is a significant hindrance to many farmers looking to expand. “Look at me–it took me almost two years to go through the permitting process for a new processing facility. That raised our costs from $500,000 to $1.8 million, just because it took so long. It’s put me in jeopardy basically. We definitely need an expedited process, and more incentives for farmers to invest in the future.”</p>\n", "direction"=>"ltr"}, "categories"=>["user/17398194162169227368/label/activism", "user/17398194162169227368/label/business", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/reading-list", "user/17398194162169227368/label/cooperativism", "user/17398194162169227368/label/environmentalism", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/fresh", "Media/News"], "updated"=>1279760207}, {"likingUsers"=>[], "comments"=>[], "author"=>"The Cornucopia Institute", "title"=>"Community Supported Agriculture Provides Links to Healthy Foods", "crawlTimeMsec"=>"1279760824215", "published"=>1279759831, "annotations"=>[], "alternate"=>[{"href"=>"http://www.cornucopia.org/2010/07/community-supported-agriculture-provides-links-to-healthy-foods/", "type"=>"text/html"}], "id"=>"tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/560bf580ab8092ce", "origin"=>{"title"=>"Cornucopia Institute", "htmlUrl"=>"http://www.cornucopia.org", "streamId"=>"feed/http://cornucopia.org/index.php/feed/"}, "content"=>{"content"=>"<p><strong>Consumers buy ‘shares,’ get fresh local produce </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100721/NEWS01/7210301/1001/NEWS\"><em>Fort Wayne News Sentinel</em></a><br>\n<em>By Lauren Caggiano</em></p>\n<p>Local consumers have discovered another way to avoid the middleman when it comes to buying fresh produce.</p>\n<p>Over the last 20 years, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) has emerged as an alternative to buying grocery store produce. In short, CSA makes it possible for consumers to buy local, seasonal food directly from a farmer.</p>\n<p>The concept is founded on a transactional relationship between the consumer and the farmer.  A farmer offers a certain number of “shares” of the projected crops to the public, who then become “members.” Members help pay for seeds and additional costs.</p>\n<p>In return, the farm provides, to the best of its ability, an abundant supply of seasonal fresh produce throughout the growing season. <span></span></p>\n<p>Most often, this consists of a box of vegetables, but other farm products, like dairy items, may be included. Due to weather and things beyond the farmer’s control, the dates of produce availability are subject to change.</p>\n<p><strong>A ‘win-win situation’</strong></p>\n<p>Proponents of CSA argue it’s a win-win situation for the consumer and the farmer.</p>\n<p>“CSAs provide a link for healthy local food between consumers and the producer,” said Ricky Kemery, horticulture educator at the Allen County office of the Purdue Cooperative Extension service. “They help the local economy by providing a ready-made market for the local small producer. This reduces the risk that farmers take when they produce a crop(s) and then have to search for places to sell their product.”</p>\n<p>It’s also common for produce to be shipped hundreds or thousands of miles to distribution centers before ultimately ending up on the shelves of a local supermarket. Those transportation costs can be reduced if more consumers purchased local produce, Kemery said.</p>\n<p>Finally, Kemery said CSAs help urban dwellers become re-connected with nature and learn to appreciate and understand food production.</p>\n<p>“CSAs will have a hard time taking (the) place of supermarkets, but they are an alternative for folks who prefer local produce and want to promote a sustainable local economy,” he said.</p>\n<p><strong>Other benefits</strong></p>\n<p>For Addie Bhuiya, CSA coordinator for Graber Farms in Harlan, the difference between store-bought products and fresh-from-the farm produce is the health benefit. The farming methods that most CSA farmers follow are no-spray or organic, Bhuiya said. Ultimately, this is better for the world’s water supplies, wildlife and soil, which need to be preserved for future generations.</p>\n<p>Another added benefit is the sense of community CSA tends to create:</p>\n<p>“It is a really great way to get to know people that have like-minded interests,” she said. </p>\n<p><strong>Getting involved</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some of the community-supported agriculture providers in the Fort Wayne, Indiana area:</p>\n<ol>\n♦Country Garden &amp; Farm Market\n<p>Address: 1410 U.S. 24 West, Roanoke</p>\n<p>Phone: 672-1254</p>\n<p>Share prices: $120-$1,026</p>\n<p>Note: Check Web site for information on discounts.</p>\n<p>♦Goldwood Gardens</p>\n<p>Address: 4750 W. 350 North, northwest of Columbia City</p>\n<p>Phone: 1-260-244-6482</p>\n<p>Share prices: $250-$450</p>\n<p>Contact: Canda Goldwood, 1-260-244-6482</p>\n<p>♦Graber Farms</p>\n<p>Address: 26409 Springfield Center Road, Harlan</p>\n<p>Phone: 657-5061</p>\n<p>Share prices: $480-$825</p>\n<p>Contact: Addie Bhuiya, CSA coordinator, 241-7309 or <a href=\"mailto:aebhuiya@%20yahoo.com\">aebhuiya@ yahoo.com</a></p>\n<p>Note: CSA members get a 5 percent discount off you-pick cost for produce.</p>\n<p>♦Little Hillside CSA</p>\n<p>Address: Delivery only</p>\n<p>Phone: 403-3101</p>\n<p>Share prices: $40-$75</p>\n<p>Contact: Paul Oberly, 403-3101</p>\n<p>Note: Due to the small size of the operation, Little Hillside currently limits memberships to 20 per year, on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n<p>♦Old Loon Farm</p>\n<p>Address: 7551 N.

The giggling murderers caught on tape do not appear to have suffered any official consequences, but the soldier who exposed the killings to public scrutiny has been arrested.</p>\n<p>Manning’s increasing disillusionment with the Army was punctuated by episodes including his discovery that Iraqis had been arrested for criticizing corruption in the Prime Minister’s cabinet. After he brought the issue to his officers he was told to shut up and get more detainees. Eventually, in the face of court martial and the harshest “military justice,” Manning allegedly decided to release classified information to Wikileaks.</p>\n<p>Problems arose when he discussed his actions with the wrong person. Adrian Lamo, deciding to take the side of occupation and murder cover-ups, provided investigators with records of communications in which Manning allegedly discussed his law-breaking.</p>\n<p>So Manning felt a need to talk. Maybe even to brag to someone. This was a tactical error that doesn’t make his actions any less honorable. Are people only to act selflessly and negate pride and ambition? Nobody meets this standard. Manning just failed to exercise proper judgment.</p>\n<p>Detractors have tried to invalidate Manning’s actions by claiming that he had psychological problems or saying that he was in trouble for assaulting another soldier. If someone is unable to hold himself together while figuring out the right thing to do, it only shows that he wasn’t strong enough to prevail all of the time against forces that yanked at his conscience. And who is rational all of the time anyway?</p>\n<p>As for allegations of assault, Manning was in a profession with the explicit purpose of doing violence. If he used violence inappropriately, the best thing to do would be to try to make restitution and redeem himself. Exposing the violence the system tries to hide seems a good step towards this goal.</p>\n<p>Why shouldn’t Manning have been angry at the system and those knowingly complicit in it? If oppression wasn’t so infuriating, it might never be fought against.</p>\n<p>Everybody must deal with stress and everybody makes mistakes. A hero is not someone without weakness. A hero is someone who manages to do the right thing in spite of his weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Manning realized the tyranny of an organization he played an active part in. Instead of force-feeding himself more propaganda or eating his gun, he did something positive about it.</p>\n<p>As Henry David Thoreau said in Civil Disobedience, “Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience, then?”</p>\n<p>Bradley Manning did not resign his conscience to his officers or to policy makers.</p>\n<p>His moral choice provides an example for others to look to. If more soldiers, commanders, and politicians took responsibility for their actions and honestly evaluated the claims of authority that have been battered into them since birth, the world would be much better.</p>\n<p>Holding heroes to an unrealistic standard of perfection means idolizing lies. The truth is, nobody is that great. Some overcome their flaws to do great things. When Bradley Manning found that he was complicit in the violent suppression of freedom, he did the best he could to make things right.</p>\n<p>And now he sits in a jail cell while those who make the policies of death sleep comfortably.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=-Ebjz5n0bwM:kvy0PG29pRQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"

href=\"http://c4ss.org/content/3197\">Homeland Security Mission Creep:  ‘Intellectual Propety Crime’</a>“),  I wrote that file-sharing had apparently become the latest “terrorist threat” targeted by the national  security state.  Against this background, the immediatelty following shutdown of 73,000 blogs using the blogetery Wordpress platform hosted by Burstnet is especially alarming.  Burstnet announced that, in compliance with an urgent and extraordinary request by “law enforcement officials,” it was shutting down blogetery.   Their motivation is suggested by the tens of thousands of hits if you Google the blogetery site for “rapidshare” and “megaupload.”</p>\n<p>Maybe this is what Holy Handwringing Joe Lieberman meant by an Internet “kill switch” to protect against “terrorism.”</p>\n<p>This is just the latest example of a growing phenomenon:  businesses treating their own customers as criminal suspects, while serving “the Authorities” as their primary actual clientele.  That’s why your bank informs the Feds of large money transactions, Home Depot reports purchases of chemicals used in meth labs, and the drug store keeps track of the amount of Sudafed you buy.</p>\n<p>The first question that comes to mind is:  Who pays Burstnet’s bills — “the Authorities” or the customers?</p>\n<p>A friend at work recently had a relevant experience with her broadband ISP, Cox Communications.  Apparently her grandkids had downloaded a movie from some torrent site and Disney had leaned on Cox (with Cox presumably rolling over and giving them customer records without due process).  The lady at the cable office called her up and began warning her “You need to monitor your grandkids more closely,” and assorted other things she “needed to do.”  Normally I’d expect that kind of condescending lecture from someone who was paying ME money, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t had your daily dose of irony, Secretary of State Clinton recently warned other countries against the dangers of imposing burdens on civil society:  “progress in the 21st century depends on the ability of individuals to coalesce around shared goals, and harness the power of their convictions. But when governments crack down on the right of citizens to work together, as they have throughout history, societies fall into stagnation and decay.”</p>\n<p>Clinton added that “Democracies don’t fear their own people.”  I imagine the guy in the Guy Fawkes mask would get a big laugh out of  that.  For a government that doesn’t fear its own people, the U.S. “democracy” spends an awful lot of time obsessing over whether we’re ingesting prohibited substances into our own bodies, downloading songs, and other “terroristic” activities that it’s made its business.  Talk about paranoia!  “Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they have imagined to do.”</p>\n<p>The shutdown of file-sharing sites will probably backfire, I’m afraid.  Such authoritarian actions by the Copyright Nazis and their government spear-carriers will, I fear, lead to an outcome that should alarm all good citizens.  Sadly, denial-of-service attacks against the websites of various government agencies, the RIAA and MPAA, have become increasingly frequent in recent years.  If you’re the kind of juvenile person who takes misguided pleasure in seeing bad things happen to some of the most wicked people in the world, just Google “DOS+attack RIAA+website.”   Shocking.</p>\n<p>At one time the cat and mouse game between hackers and the RIAA got so intense that for a while the RIAA was constantly shifting its site around between low-profile servers, to protect itself from hackers (kind of like Saddam randomly sleeping in a different palace every night as an anti-assassination precaution).</p>\n<p>The latest such incident was “Operation T*tstorm,” a distributed DOS attack by the hacker group “Anonymous” on the sites of the Australian Parliament and Ministry of Communications in retaliation for increased censorship of porn websites.</p>\n<p>Thank God these poor misguided anti-social saps have mitigated the potential harm by focusing up till now on  the public websites of organizations they hate, instead of on the intranets on which their actual functioning as organizations depends.  I greatly fear that someday soon some utterly reprehensible sociopath will manage to do this, and when someone like Mitch Bainwol shows up at work and logs on to check his email, he’ll see nothing but a blank screen.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?i=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?i=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?i=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?i=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?a=auTfEFaefHo:shmhwuTzums:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/c4ss?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/c4ss/~4/auTfEFaefHo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">", "direction"=>"ltr"}, "categories"=>["user/00258619971631230464/state/com.google/broadcast", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/reading-list", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/broadcast-friends", "user/17398194162169227368/state/com.google/fresh", "Commentary"], "updated"=>1279658257}, {"likingUsers"=>[], "comments"=>[], "author"=>"Rad Geek", "title"=>"Wednesday Lazy Linking", "crawlTimeMsec"=>"1279758974686", "published"=>1279749600, "annotations"=>[], "alternate"=>[{"href"=>"http://radgeek.com/gt/2010/07/21/wednesday-lazy-linking/", "type"=>"text/html"}], "id"=>"tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/690fa557b6db7501", "origin"=>{"title"=>"Rad Geek People&#39;s Daily", "htmlUrl"=>"http://radgeek.com/", "streamId"=>"feed/http://radgeek.com/feed/atom"}, "content"=>{"content"=>"<ul>\n\t<li><p><a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FalseDichotomyByCharlesDavis/~3/7jF7fMVrYZ4/united-states-of-british-petroleum.html\">The United States of British Petroleum.
